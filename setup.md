## Software Setup

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

### Details

We will be utilizing Jupyter notebooks for most of the hands-on activities. A public JupyterHub
server has been setup for these lessons, where you can login with your institutional credentials.
Some of the lessons will require the use of a desktop GIS tool such as QGIS. You can download 
the version of QGIS for your operating system [here](https://www.qgis.org/download).
