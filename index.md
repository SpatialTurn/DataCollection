One of the primary challenges with the utilization of digital datasets in the social sciences is a lack of data literacy skills in collecting data. 
This includes both data collection from existing data repositories and field-based data collections such as observation data, interviews, and surveys. 
This module will provide learning materials on both sides to prepare the researchers with data collection skills at beginner, intermediate, and expert levels.
