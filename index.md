## Data Collection Module

One of the primary challenges with the utilization of digital datasets in the social sciences is a lack of data literacy skills in collecting data. 
This includes both data collection from existing data repositories and field-based data collections such as observation data, interviews, and surveys. 
This module will provide learning materials on both sides to prepare the researchers with data collection skills at beginner, intermediate, and expert levels.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- learn how to access different common repositories of existing tabular and imagery datasets relevant to the social science using desktop and API interfaces
- learn about common methods and software options for capturing original data in the field
- reflect on the steps for designing a data collection workflow using existing or original geospatial data
- build a basic GIS project file and data collection system and QGIS geopackage based on an example use case
